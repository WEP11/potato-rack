# potato-rack
Potato Rack is an attempt at a lightweight, PostgreSQL based IT inventory manager that is compatible with SSO solutions (mainly phpCAS). The main components will be:

- Server inventory management
- Server rack space management
- Network interface and hostname management
- Network interface firewall rules
- Multiple Authentication Methods (None, htaccess, or phpCAS)

This is designed around a protected local network, thus there may be some security leniencies around. Feel free to submit a PR if you wish to contribute an edit.
